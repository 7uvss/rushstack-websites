## IHeftTaskSession interface

The task session is responsible for providing session-specific information to Heft task plugins. The session provides access to the hooks that Heft will run as part of task execution, as well as access to parameters provided via the CLI. The session is also how you request access to other task plugins.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export interface IHeftTaskSession
```
