## PnpmOptionsConfiguration.globalNeverBuiltDependencies property

The `globalNeverBuiltDependencies` setting suppresses the `preinstall`<></>, `install`<></>, and `postinstall` lifecycle events for the specified NPM dependencies. This is useful for scripts with poor practices such as downloading large binaries without retries or attempting to invoke OS tools such as a C++ compiler. (PNPM's terminology refers to these lifecycle events as "building" a package; it has nothing to do with build system operations such as `rush build` or `rushx build`<></>.) The settings are copied into the `pnpm.neverBuiltDependencies` field of the `common/temp/package.json` file that is generated by Rush during installation.
