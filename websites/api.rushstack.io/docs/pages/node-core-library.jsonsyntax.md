## Enumeration Members

|  Member | Value | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  Json5 | <code>&quot;json5&quot;</code> | JSON5 is a project that proposes a JSON-like format supplemented with ECMAScript 5.1 notations for objects, numbers, comments, and more. |
|  JsonWithComments | <code>&quot;jsonWithComments&quot;</code> | <code>JsonSyntax.JsonWithComments</code> is the recommended format for human-authored config files. It is a minimal extension to <code>JsonSyntax.Strict</code> adding support for code comments using <code>//</code> and <code>/*</code>. |
|  Strict | <code>&quot;strict&quot;</code> | Specifies the exact RFC 8259 format as implemented by the <code>JSON.parse()</code> system API. This format was designed for machine generated inputs such as an HTTP payload. It is not a recommend choice for human-authored files, because it does not support code comments. |
