## ApiReadonlyMixin.isReadonly property

Indicates that the API item's value cannot be assigned by an external consumer.

**Signature:**

```typescript
readonly isReadonly: boolean;
```

## Remarks

Examples of API items that would be considered "read only" by API Extractor:

- A class or interface's property that has the `readonly` modifier.

- A variable that has the `const` modifier.

- A property or variable whose TSDoc comment includes the `@readonly` tag.

- A property declaration with a getter but no setter.

Note that if the `readonly` keyword appears in a type annotation, this does not guarantee that that the API item will be considered readonly. For example:

```ts
declare class C {
  // isReadonly=false in this case, because C.x is assignable
  public x: readonly string[];
}
```
