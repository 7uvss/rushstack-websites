## ISubprocessOptions.detached property

> This API is provided as a preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.

Whether or not the child process was started in detached mode.

**Signature:**

```typescript
detached: boolean;
```

## Remarks

On POSIX systems, detached=true is required for killing the subtree. Attempting to kill the subtree on POSIX systems with detached=false will throw an error. On Windows, detached=true creates a separate console window and is not required for killing the subtree. In general, it is recommended to use SubprocessTerminator.RECOMMENDED_OPTIONS when forking or spawning a child process.
