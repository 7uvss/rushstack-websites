## RushConstants.buildCacheVersion property

> This API is provided as a preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.

Build cache version number, incremented when the logic to create cache entries changes. Changing this ensures that cache entries generated by an old version will no longer register as a cache hit.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
static readonly buildCacheVersion: number;
```
