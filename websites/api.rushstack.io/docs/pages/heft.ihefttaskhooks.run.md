## IHeftTaskHooks.run property

The `run` hook is called after all dependency task executions have completed during a normal run, or during a watch mode run when no `runIncremental` hook is provided. It is where the plugin can perform its work. To use it, call `run.tapPromise(<pluginName>, <callback>)`<></>.

**Signature:**

```typescript
readonly run: AsyncParallelHook<IHeftTaskRunHookOptions>;
```
