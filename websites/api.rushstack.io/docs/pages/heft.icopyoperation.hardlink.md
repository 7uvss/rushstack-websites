## ICopyOperation.hardlink property

Hardlink files instead of copying.

**Signature:**

```typescript
hardlink?: boolean;
```

## Remarks

If the sourcePath is a folder, the contained directory structure will be re-created and all files will be individually hardlinked. This means that folders will be new filesystem entities and will have separate folder metadata, while the contained files will maintain normal hardlink behavior. This is done since folders do not have a cross-platform equivalent of a hardlink, and since file symlinks provide fundamentally different functionality in comparison to hardlinks.
