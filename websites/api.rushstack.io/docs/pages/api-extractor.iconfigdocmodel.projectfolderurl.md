[Home](./index.md) &gt; [@microsoft/api-extractor](./api-extractor.md) &gt; [IConfigDocModel](./api-extractor.iconfigdocmodel.md) &gt; [projectFolderUrl](./api-extractor.iconfigdocmodel.projectfolderurl.md)

## IConfigDocModel.projectFolderUrl property

The base URL where the project's source code can be viewed on a website such as GitHub or Azure DevOps. This URL path corresponds to the `<projectFolder>` path on disk.

**Signature:**

```typescript
projectFolderUrl?: string;
```

## Remarks

This URL is concatenated with the file paths serialized to the doc model to produce URL file paths to individual API items. For example, if the `projectFolderUrl` is "https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack/tree/main/apps/api-extractor" and an API item's file path is "api/ExtractorConfig.ts", the full URL file path would be "https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack/tree/main/apps/api-extractor/api/ExtractorConfig.js".

Can be omitted if you don't need source code links in your API documentation reference.
