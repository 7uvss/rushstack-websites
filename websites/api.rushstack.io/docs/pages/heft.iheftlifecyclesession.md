## IHeftLifecycleSession interface

The lifecycle session is responsible for providing session-specific information to Heft lifecycle plugins. The session provides access to the hooks that Heft will run as part of lifecycle execution, as well as access to parameters provided via the CLI. The session is also how you request access to other lifecycle plugins.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export interface IHeftLifecycleSession
```
