Heft is actively developed by the [Rush Stack](@rushstack/) community. There are various community options for help:

- **Found a bug?** You can [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack/issues)
  in the **rushstack** monorepo where Rush is developed

- **Zulip**: Chat with Rush developers in the Rush Stack [Zulip chat room](https://rushstack.zulipchat.com/)

- **If a PR needs attention,** try asking in the
  [#contributor-helpline](https://rushstack.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/279883-contributor-helpline)
  chat room. We carefully review each submission before merging, which is time consuming work. The maintainers
  are all people who manage large corporate monorepos with regular daily distractions, so PRs frequently
  get overlooked. Your contributions are greatly appreciated -- we do want to get that PR reviewed!
