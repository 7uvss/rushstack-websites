| common/scripts/install-run-rush.js      | CI bootstrap script for invoking `rush`. The `rush update` generates this file, which should be committed to Git. See [Enabling CI builds](../maintainer/enabling_ci_builds.md) for details. |
| common/scripts/install-run-rush-pnpm.js | CI bootstrap script for invoking [rush-pnpm](../commands/rush-pnpm.md).                                                                                                                      |

| common/temp/npm-cache/...     | A local NPM cache will be created here. Rush does not use the global NPM cache due to its concurrency problems.                              |
| common/temp/npm-local/...     | Based on the **npmVersion** setting, Rush will install NPM in your home directory and create a symlink to it for each repo that requests it. |
| common/temp/npm-tmp/...       | Temporary files created by NPM during installation.                                                                                          |

| common/temp/last-install.flag | Don't worry about this file. It tracks the timestamp of the last successful `rush install`.                                                  |
| common/temp/package.json      | The common package definition.                                                                                                               |
| common/temp/rush-link.json    | Don't worry about this file. It is created whenever you run `rush link`, and read by later commands such as "rush build".                    |
